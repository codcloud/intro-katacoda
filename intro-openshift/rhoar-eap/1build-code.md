Let's start right off with running some code inside of JBoss EAP. We are going to:

1. Fork a Github repository into your own account
2. Build and run that code in JBoss EAP on OpenShift

## Forking the Github repository

Make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com). Then proceed to the [following repository](). It has a simple [JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) service that generates a Dungeon & Dragons character when you hit the endpoint. 

On the top of the Github page you will see a button called "Fork". Please go ahead and select this button and place the git fork in one of your Github organizations.

__NOTE__ If you do not fork the code, you can use the provided repository but you won't be able to do the code change exercise later in this scenario. 

## Getting the clone URL for your fork



## Using the OpenShift Web Console to build and deploy your code




In the next step we will make a route to our application
